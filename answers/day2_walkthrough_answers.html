<li>We use <code>across()</code> to apply <code>mean()</code> and <code>sd()</code> to multiple numeric columns at once, avoiding repetitive code.<br>
</li>
<li>The selected features—<code>popularity</code>, <code>danceability</code>, <code>energy</code>, and <code>tempo</code>—are each summarized with both statistics.<br>
</li>
<li>The <code>list()</code> inside <code>across()</code> allows us to define multiple summary functions at once.<br>
</li>
<li><code>pivot_longer()</code> reshapes the wide summary output into long format, with separate <code>feature</code> and <code>stat</code> columns.<br>
</li>
<li>This tidy format is ideal for further analysis or plotting, especially when comparing metrics across features.</li>

<ul>
<li>We define a custom function using <code>str_extract()</code> to pull featured artist names from track titles that include phrases like <code>(feat. ...)</code> or <code>(with ...)</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>The regex uses lookarounds to extract the text inside parentheses without keeping the parentheses themselves.<br>
</li>
<li>We apply this function to every track using <code>map_chr()</code> from the <code>purrr</code> package, creating a new column <code>feature_raw</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>Filtering for non-<code>NA</code> values isolates only those tracks that contain featured artists.<br>
</li>
<li>Sampling 30 rows gives us a quick view of how featured artists appear in the data.</li>

<li>We define a custom function <code>is_all_caps()</code> that detects if a string is written entirely in uppercase letters, allowing spaces, numbers, and punctuation.<br>
</li>
<li>The function also ensures that at least one A–Z letter is present, avoiding false positives like strings made only of symbols.<br>
</li>
<li><code>map_lgl()</code> applies the function to each track name, producing a new logical column <code>is_shouting</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>We insert the new column right after <code>track_name</code> using <code>.after</code>, keeping the data tidy and readable.<br>
</li>
<li>Sorting the dataset by <code>is_shouting</code> brings all uppercase titles to the top for easy inspection.<br>
</li>
<li>Finally, we use <code>count()</code> to summarize how many shouting vs.&nbsp;non-shouting titles are in the dataset.</li>

<ul>
<li>We use <code>map()</code> to apply the same filtering and transformation steps to the top 3 genres, producing a list of genre-specific data frames.<br>
</li>
<li><code>separate_rows()</code> splits artist collaborations so each artist gets their own row, allowing for accurate counts.<br>
</li>
<li>Each mini data frame keeps only the <code>track_name</code> and <code>artists</code> columns for focused analysis.<br>
</li>
<li><code>reduce()</code> with <code>bind_rows()</code> merges all the genre-specific data frames into one unified dataset.<br>
</li>
<li>The final <code>count()</code> tallies how often each artist appears across the top genres, highlighting the most active contributors.<br>
</li>
<li>This pattern is great for when you need to analyze subgroups separately before combining results for broader insight.</li>

<li>The use of <code>str_to_lower()</code> ensures matches regardless of capitalization (e.g., “May”, “MAY”, “may”).<br>

<ul>
<li>We define a single function that bundles three tasks: finding the top-valued track, counting missing values, and creating a histogram for a given feature.<br>
</li>
<li><code>.data[[var]]</code> lets us dynamically reference column names inside <code>dplyr</code> and <code>ggplot2</code>, making the function reusable.<br>
</li>
<li>The <code>top_track</code> output shows which song has the highest value for the selected feature.<br>
</li>
<li>The <code>missing</code> count gives quick insight into data quality for each feature.<br>
</li>
<li>Each <code>plot</code> is a histogram of the feature’s distribution, styled with customizable arguments like <code>bins</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>Mapping the function over multiple features automates a detailed, consistent summary for each variable.</li>

### Session 4 Review Question Answers

**`(4.1)`** What is the primary benefit of using `map_*()` functions from the **`purrr`** package?  
**Correct Answer:**  
**B.** They eliminate the need for using loops by applying a function across lists or vectors, returning a consistent output type.

**Explanation:**  
`map_*()` functions (like `map_dbl()`, `map_chr()`) replace loops with concise, type-safe iteration, ensuring uniform output structures.

---

**`(4.2)`** In the context of functional programming in R, what is a key reason for using `walk()` instead of `map()`?  
**Correct Answer:**  
**C.** `walk()` is for performing operations with side effects (e.g., saving plots), where you don’t need a return value.

**Explanation:**  
Unlike `map()`, which returns a value, `walk()` is used when the function's purpose is the action itself, like writing files or printing.

---

**`(4.3)`** What is a major advantage of defining reusable functions (e.g., `is_all_caps()` or `feature_info_plot()`), especially when paired with `map()`?  
**Correct Answer:**  
**C.** It supports clearer, modular code that can be reused and debugged more easily.

**Explanation:**  
Encapsulating logic into small, named functions improves code clarity and allows consistent reuse across multiple inputs with `map()`.

---

**`(4.4)`** How does the `reduce()` function complement `map()` when working with lists?  
**Correct Answer:**  
**B.** It sequentially combines list elements using a binary function, such as merging multiple data frames.

**Explanation:**  
While `map()` transforms each list element, `reduce()` is used to combine them—e.g., stacking multiple data frames into one using `bind_rows`.

---

**`(4.5)`** Which scenario best illustrates the use of `imap_lgl()` in exploratory analysis?  
**Correct Answer:**  
**C.** Searching all character columns to identify which contain a specific keyword like “may”.

**Explanation:**  
`imap_lgl()` applies a function to each column (and can use column names), returning a logical vector—perfect for targeted searches.

<ul>
<li>We create a scatterplot using <code>ggplot2</code> to explore the relationship between <code>danceability</code> and <code>energy</code>.<br>
</li>
<li><code>geom_point(alpha = 0.4)</code> adds transparency, helping reveal patterns even in dense areas of the plot.<br>
</li>
<li>Clear axis labels and a title make the visualization easy to interpret.<br>
</li>
<li>Wrapping the plot in <code>ggplotly()</code> converts it into an interactive chart with zoom, pan, and tooltip support.<br>
</li>
<li>This quick upgrade improves usability and is ideal for data exploration, teaching, or interactive reporting.</li>

</li>
<li><code>ggplotly(..., tooltip = "text")</code> ensures that the interactive tooltips use our custom hover text.<br>
</li>
<li>This approach enhances user experience by adding context to each point in the plot, making it ideal for exploration or dashboards.</li>

<ul>
<li>We use <code>count(track_genre, sort = TRUE)</code> to tally how many tracks belong to each genre, ordered from most to least.<br>
</li>
<li><code>plot_ly()</code> builds an interactive bar chart with <code>type = "bar"</code> and uses <code>reorder()</code> to sort genres along the x-axis.<br>
</li>
<li>Custom hover text (<code>paste(n, "tracks")</code>) enhances readability when exploring the plot.<br>
</li>
<li><code>hoverinfo = "text"</code> ensures only the custom tooltip is shown, not raw values.<br>
</li>
<li><code>layout()</code> adds a clear title and axis labels, making the plot suitable for reports or dashboards.<br>
</li>
<li>This example demonstrates how to create sleek, interactive summaries of categorical variables with minimal code.</li>

<ul>
<li>We use <code>plot_ly()</code> with <code>type = "box"</code> to visualize the distribution of <code>energy</code> across music genres.<br>
</li>
<li>Each boxplot shows the median, interquartile range, and potential outliers for that genre’s energy scores.<br>
</li>
<li>The interactive format allows users to hover and explore exact values, enhancing interpretability.<br>
</li>
<li><code>layout()</code> adds informative axis labels and a descriptive title for clarity.<br>
</li>
<li>This plot is great for comparing variability and central tendencies across categories in an engaging way.</li>

<ul>
<li>We use <code>pivot_longer()</code> to reshape multiple audio features into a long format, enabling easy comparison across variables.<br>
</li>
<li>The resulting dataset has one column for feature names (<code>feature</code>) and one for their values (<code>value</code>).<br>
</li>
<li><code>facet_wrap()</code> creates a separate boxplot for each feature, grouped by <code>popular_or_not</code>, with independent y-axis scales.<br>
</li>
<li><code>geom_boxplot()</code> summarizes each feature’s distribution, highlighting medians, quartiles, and outliers.<br>
</li>
<li>Converting the plot with <code>ggplotly()</code> adds interactivity, letting users hover over each box to see exact values.<br>
</li>
<li>This method is ideal for visualizing how multiple features differ between groups in a clean, side-by-side layout.</li>

<ul>
<li>We filter the <code>weather</code> dataset for Flagstaff (FLG) and convert hourly timestamps to calendar dates using <code>as_date()</code>.<br>
</li>
<li><code>group_by(date)</code> and <code>summarize()</code> compute the <strong>maximum wind gust</strong> for each day.<br>
</li>
<li><code>plot_ly()</code> creates an interactive line chart with <code>type = "scatter"</code> and <code>mode = "lines"</code> to show the trend over time.<br>
</li>
<li>The interactive plot supports zooming and tooltips, making it easy to explore peaks and seasonal variation.<br>
</li>
<li>Axis labels and a clear title are added using <code>layout()</code> to improve readability and presentation.<br>
</li>
<li>This visualization is ideal for analyzing time-based trends in weather or other sensor-style datasets.</li>

<ul>
<li>We filter and summarize flight data to calculate the on-time departure and arrival rates by origin and carrier.<br>
</li>
<li><code>percent()</code> from the <code>scales</code> package formats these rates for display in tooltips.<br>
</li>
<li>Each point in the scatterplot represents a unique origin–carrier pair, sized by number of flights and colored by airport.<br>
</li>
<li>A 45° dashed line indicates equal performance for departures and arrivals, making deviations easy to spot.<br>
</li>
<li>Custom tooltips include origin, carrier name, performance metrics, and total flights, enhancing user interaction.<br>
</li>
<li><code>ggplotly()</code> makes the plot interactive, letting viewers hover to explore detailed airline punctuality.</li>

<ul>
<li>We filter out missing values and count how many respondents preferred each weather source.<br>
</li>
<li>A new column <code>pct</code> calculates the percentage of responses per source, formatted with <code>scales::percent()</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>Custom hover text is created with <code>paste0()</code> to include source name, count, and percentage.<br>
</li>
<li><code>plot_ly()</code> generates an interactive horizontal bar chart, with bars ordered by response count.<br>
</li>
<li><code>hoverinfo = "text"</code> ensures only the custom tooltips are shown when hovering.<br>
</li>
<li>This visualization clearly highlights the most common weather sources while enabling detailed exploration.</li>

<ul>
<li>We use <code>plot_ly()</code> with <code>type = "histogram"</code> to visualize the distribution of the <code>energy</code> feature.<br>
</li>
<li>Custom styling improves readability with light blue bars and bold black outlines.<br>
</li>
<li>A range slider is added to the x-axis, allowing users to zoom into specific energy ranges interactively.<br>
</li>
<li><code>layout()</code> defines axis labels and the chart title, making the plot informative and presentation-ready.<br>
</li>
<li>This interactive design is great for exploring distributions with variability or subtle structure.</li>

<li>We compute monthly high temperatures using <code>max(temp)</code> grouped by airport, year, and month for a clear seasonal summary.<br>
</li>
<li>Month labels are extracted with <code>month(..., label = TRUE)</code> for improved plot readability.<br>
</li>
<li>A detailed tooltip is created with <code>paste0()</code>, combining airport, month, year, and temperature info.<br>
</li>
<li><code>interaction(year, origin)</code> ensures each line represents a unique airport–year combination in the plot.<br>
</li>
<li><code>ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text")</code> adds interactivity, enabling users to hover for insights and compare trends across time and location.<br>
</li>
<li>This is a great example of combining temporal, spatial, and statistical elements into one clear and engaging chart.</li>

<p><strong><code>(5.1)</code></strong> What is the primary advantage of using <code>ggplotly()</code> with an existing <code>ggplot2</code> plot?</p>
<p>A. It converts the plot into an interactive version with hover, zoom, and pan capabilities.<br>
B. It exports the plot directly to PowerPoint or PDF with built-in animations.<br>
C. It adds static labels to each point for easier print output.<br>
D. It improves rendering performance by simplifying the plot structure.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>(5.2)</code></strong> Why is specifying the <code>tooltip = "text"</code> argument useful in <code>ggplotly()</code>?</p>
<p>A. It automatically maps data aesthetics like size or color into tooltips.<br>
B. It links tooltips to custom text content, allowing for more informative hover details.<br>
C. It ensures that labels are automatically translated into multiple languages.<br>
D. It prevents tooltips from showing variable names when using <code>plot_ly()</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>(5.3)</code></strong> In <code>plot_ly()</code>, which of the following enhances the readability of categorical plots like bar charts?</p>
<p>A. Setting <code>hoverinfo = "none"</code> to reduce distractions<br>
B. Using <code>facet_wrap()</code> to group categories into subplots<br>
C. Adding annotations using <code>geom_text()</code><br>
D. Sorting categories manually by reordering the <code>y</code> aesthetic</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>(5.4)</code></strong> When creating an interactive histogram with a range slider in <code>plotly</code>, which element must be specified?</p>
<p>A. <code>range_slider = "x"</code> in the histogram trace definition<br>
B. <code>rangeSelector = TRUE</code> in the histogram layout<br>
C. <code>add_slider()</code> inside <code>geom_histogram()</code><br>
D. <code>rangeslider = list(visible = TRUE)</code> inside the <code>xaxis</code> layout</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>(5.5)</code></strong> What is the benefit of transforming a dataset to long format before plotting multiple features interactively?</p>
<p>A. It enables easier comparison of multiple variables across a common grouping, such as <code>popular_or_not</code>.<br>
B. It prevents the need to use the <code>pivot_wider()</code> function for grouped bar plots.<br>
C. It simplifies layout by removing the need for facetting or coloring.<br>
D. It allows faster computation since each column becomes a numeric vector.</p>

### Session 5 Review Question Answers

**`(5.1)`**  
**Correct Answer:** A. It converts the plot into an interactive version with hover, zoom, and pan capabilities.  
**Explanation:** `ggplotly()` transforms static ggplot2 plots into interactive ones, making it easier to explore the data dynamically.

---

**`(5.2)`**  
**Correct Answer:** B. It links tooltips to custom text content, allowing for more informative hover details.  
**Explanation:** The `text` aesthetic allows you to fully customize hover text when passed into `ggplotly()` with `tooltip = "text"`.

---

**`(5.3)`**  
**Correct Answer:** D. Sorting categories manually by reordering the `y` aesthetic  
**Explanation:** Reordering categorical axes improves the interpretability of bar charts by presenting data in a logical order.

---

**`(5.4)`**  
**Correct Answer:** D. `rangeslider = list(visible = TRUE)` inside the `xaxis` layout  
**Explanation:** This adds a zoomable slider on the x-axis of a histogram, enhancing interactivity.

---

**`(5.5)`**  
**Correct Answer:** A. It enables easier comparison of multiple variables across a common grouping, such as `popular_or_not`.  
**Explanation:** Long-format data is ideal for faceting and grouped comparisons in ggplot2 and plotly visualizations.

<li>We create an interactive dodged bar chart to compare fruit shapes by growth form, using <code>plot_ly()</code> for interactivity.<br>
</li>
<li>Bars are grouped side-by-side (<code>barmode = "group"</code>) to compare the number of species for each fruit shape and growth form.<br>
</li>
<li>Custom tooltips display additional information, making the chart more informative when hovering over the bars.</li>

<ul>
<li>We create a faceted scatterplot to compare fruit length vs.&nbsp;width, with separate plots for each palm subfamily.<br>
</li>
<li>Tooltips display detailed species-level information, including fruit dimensions and subfamily.<br>
</li>
<li>Faceting allows for easy comparison of how fruit dimensions vary across subfamilies, while interactivity enhances data exploration.</li>
