## Revisiting the EDA Process

- EDA is a structured way to explore and understand your data  
- In this case study, we will follow three major stages:  
  - **Load and clean**: standardize column names, check for missing values  
  - **Understand structure**: explore variable types, counts, and summaries  
  - **Uncover patterns**: relationships between traits, grouped summaries, and visualizations

This case study brings together everything we've learned. From the first step of loading the data and cleaning it with `clean_names()`, we move through the classic stages of EDA.

We check for missing values, understand the types of variables (categorical vs numeric), and use summaries and plots to start uncovering trends.

The goal? Go from raw, messy data to insight-ready structure—and along the way, build questions and hypotheses about what we’re seeing.

## Core EDA Tools in Action

- Use `janitor`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `purrr` for transformation and summaries  
- Use `ggplot2` and `plotly` to visualize structure, relationships, and distributions  
- Revisit key functions (and many more!):  
  - `summarize()`, `mutate()`, `pivot_longer()`  
  - `group_by()`, `count()`, `map_df()`  
  - `ggplot()`, `plot_ly()`, `ggplotly()`  

::: {.notes}
This case study gives us a chance to apply all the tools we've learned:

- `janitor::clean_names()` for cleaning,  
- `summarize()` and `map()` for summarizing,  
- `ggplot()` and `plot_ly()` for visual storytelling.

You’ve seen these in isolation—but together, they build a full EDA pipeline. You now know how to explore data from scratch using tidyverse tools.

## Thinking with Data: From Traits to Trends

- Categorical traits → use bar charts and counts  
- Numeric traits  → use histograms and boxplots  
- Combined views → use grouped or faceted plots  
- Always return to EDA’s key questions:  
  - What’s typical?  
  - What’s unusual?  
  - What varies across groups?

::: {.notes}
We'll get revisit fundamental visual patterns:

- **Bar charts** for counts  
- **Boxplots** for comparisons  
- **Facets** to explore multiple groups simultaneously

Each visual tells a story—but only if you ask the right questions. EDA is about being curious: What’s common? What’s different? What’s worth digging into?

This case study will hopefully show that even with complex data, the same principles apply.
