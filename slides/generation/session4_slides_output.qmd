## Functional Programming for EDA

- Use `map()` and `walk()` to apply functions across columns, lists, or features
- Automate repetitive summaries or visualizations with minimal code
- Keep your analysis tidy and readable by avoiding loops
- Combine `group_split()` with `map_*()` for per-group operations

*Why functional programming?*  
It allows you to perform common data analysis tasks—like summarizing variables, generating plots, or cleaning text—at scale, without repetition.

*What you’ll learn*  
You’ll apply `map()` and `walk()` to loop over columns or grouped data. This lets you efficiently summarize features, visualize patterns, and export outputs with a few lines of code.

It’s all about automating EDA so you can focus more on interpreting insights and less on rewriting the same analysis logic.

## Automating Feature Summaries and Plots

- Define a single function that handles both data summaries and plots
- Use `map()` to loop across variables like energy, tempo, or valence
- Combine summary stats with histograms or violin plots
- Add consistent labeling, styling, and export settings

::: {.notes}
*Why automate summaries and plots?*  
Manual EDA works for 1 or 2 variables—but when you have 5, 10, or more, it gets repetitive fast. Functional programming helps you scale.

*How it works*  
You’ll create reusable functions to compute top tracks, handle missing data, and generate consistent visualizations. Then, you’ll map over a list of variables to generate everything in one go—without copying and pasting.

This saves time, avoids mistakes, and encourages consistency across your EDA workflow.

## Extracting Patterns Across Variables

- Use `imap_lgl()` to search all character columns at once
- Build quick “search engines” for exploratory keyword filtering
- Detect presence of terms like "love" or "may" across multiple fields
- Quickly identify which variables hold the information you're after

::: {.notes}
*Why search across columns?*  
Sometimes you’re not sure where a value lives—did “may” appear in the track name or the album name? With functional tools, you can scan everything at once.

*What you'll do*  
You’ll use `imap_lgl()` to apply string detection across all character columns, returning a logical vector showing where matches occur. It’s fast, flexible, and helps pinpoint hidden signals in messy data.

This is a practical way to “scan” your dataset for information during early-stage exploration.

## Nesting, Mapping, and Combining Groups

- Use `group_split()` to split a dataset into a list by group
- Apply `map()` to summarize or analyze each group separately
- Combine results using `reduce()` or `bind_rows()`
- Perfect for by-category EDA, such as genre-level summaries

::: {.notes}
*Why split and map?*  
Grouping with `group_by()` is great—but sometimes you want more control or need to apply custom logic. That’s where `group_split()` + `map()` shines.

*What you'll do*  
You’ll split your dataset into groups (like genres), analyze each group using `map()`, and recombine the results into one tidy output. This is especially useful for applying customized logic that doesn’t fit into a single tidy pipeline.

It turns group-level EDA into a modular and scalable process.

## Using `walk()` for Action-Oriented EDA

- Use `walk()` to apply a function with side effects (like saving files)
- Automate plots for multiple groups with consistent formatting
- Avoid copy-pasting `ggplot()` code by passing each group dynamically
- Helpful for building reports or exporting batch outputs

::: {.notes}
*Why `walk()` instead of `map()`?*  
`walk()` is ideal when your goal isn’t to return values—but to trigger an action, like saving a file or printing a report.

*What you’ll do*  
You’ll generate and save one plot per genre (or group), each with customized titles and filenames. This is a great way to export results from your EDA and use them in presentations or dashboards.

Functional programming doesn’t just help you analyze—it helps you deliver.
